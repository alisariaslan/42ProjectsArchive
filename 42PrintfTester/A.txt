The 452nd anniversary of William Shakespeare’s birth is coming.
He is not only known as a timeless playwright,
but also as a prolific inventor of words.
Although modern researchers have found that some words originally attributed to him,
such as puke, have earlier sources,
there are still many that hold up today as Shakespeare’s creations according to the Oxford English Dictionary:

Bandit
Henry VI, Part 2. 1594

Critic
Love’s Labour Lost. 1598.

Dauntless
Henry VI, Part 3. 1616.

Dwindle
Henry IV, Part 1. 1598.

Elbow (as a verb)
King Lear. 1608.

Green-Eyed (to describe jealousy)
The Merchant of Venice. 1600.

Lackluster
As You Like It. 1616.

Lonely
Coriolanus. 1616.

Skim-milk
Henry IV, Part 1. 1598.

Swagger
Midsummer Night’s Dream. 1600.

Shakespeare must have loved the prefix un- because he created or gave new meaning to more than 300 words that begin with it.
Here are just a few:

Unaware
Venus & Adonis. 1593.

Uncomfortable
Romeo & Juliet. 1599

Undress
Taming of the Shrew. 1616.

Unearthly
A Winter’s Tale. 1616

Unreal
Macbeth. 1623
